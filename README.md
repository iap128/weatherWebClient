# Weather Web Client
This is the web client companion for my [SparkFun Arduino Weather Station](https://github.com/iap128/WeatherStation) project. This React app will pull the data that is being stored on the SQL datababse and display it to the user.

## Running Server
To run the server part of the app, navigate to the server directory. Use command `yarn` to install package dependencies. Then use the command `node index.js` to start the backend. You can access the API from `localhost:3306/X` where X is the name of the database table.

## Running App
1. Navigate to weather-site directory
2. Use command `yarn` to install packages
3. Use command `yarn start` to run app
